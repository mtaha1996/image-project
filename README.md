# Image Provider

## Setup

1. Create a copy of all `*.env.sample` files with the name `*.env`.

2. Type `make start` in the shell.

Everything is now up and running.

Note: Since we don't have access to Google APIs, a similar API to the Google Search API has been created. You can use this API instead of the original Google API. Just change the `BASE_URL`.
